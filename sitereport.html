    <h1>Site report</h1>
    <p>At the beginning, I must note that this course was not a piece of cake for me, nither the assessment. This year was different in many ways. We started our first year at the University from our homes, because most of the courses were running online. Heavier was also the implementation of the system of university teaching. </p>
    <p>I started creating my website by writing the most important opening and closing tags, as HTML, body, and head. I added the header, main, navigation, and footer and their attributes.</p>
    <p>I assumed that my website must reflect me. I started searching for color schemes on the internet. I found a webpage, that published a list of 50 Gorgeous Color Schemes From Award. <a href=" https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/">Click to see the article</a> I decided to 47th position because of the colors I like and matching to the selected photo. I downloaded the image from unsplash.com, a free library of photos <a href="https://unsplash.com/ "> Click to see the page</a></p>
    <p>I tried to implement the code from Topic 4 to create the Hamburger icon. But something failed. At first, the middle dash has not appeared. At the second time, a middle dash appeared across the entire navigation pane. I have not known what has it been and how to fix it. I tried few times, but it has not made any step forward. At this moment I decided to search for a solution on the Internet. I decided to use code from<a href=" https://css-tricks.com/three-line-menu-navicon/"> this page.</a> But after implementing that I noticed that it is only a shadow of the first box and it covers the first link and I cannot use it. Then I started fighting again with code from Topic 4. I have not changed 100% into 1,25em. Little change but means a lot.</p>
